                <h3>Breast Cancer Screening</h3>
                <p> All women in the Bangladesh are invited to attend for screening by mammography every 3 years from age 50. This has been shown to detect many more "early" and small breast cancers than would be expected without screening. As a result it is possible to cure more women with breast cancers detected by screening than it is to cure women who present symptomatically with, for example, a breast lump. Screening does not, however, prevent breast cancer and some women will still die of breast cancer despite having regular mammography. <br> Screening women who are at increased risk of breast cancer usually starts at age 35 - 40 depending on degree of risk.<br></p>

                <h3>mastectomy surgery</h3>
                <p>A mastectomy aims to remove all the breast tissue on the affected side. There are different types of mastectomy depending upon whether a breast reconstruction is being performed at the same time.<br>Skin-sparing Mastectomy is type of mastectomy is performed if a breast reconstruction is being carried out at the same time. It aims to remove all the breast tissue whilst preserving as much of your own skin over the breast. It also removes the nipple with the breast tissue. This operation is just as safe as simple mastectomy as far as treating the cancer is concerned in suitable cases.<br>Simple mastectomy is an operation that is not associated with a lot of pain.  </p>

                <h3>Onco-plastic Breast Surgery</h3>
                <p>Oncoplastic surgery applies the principles of plastic and cosmetic breast surgery to breast cancer surgery. Some of the many potential benefits of being able to offer this range of surgical skills are:<br>Better cosmetic outcomes from breast cancer surgery - This ranges from creating a neat simple mastectomy scar, to minimising deformity after breast-conserving surgery, to breast reconstruction after mastectomy.<br>More options - One of the big areas of benefit is the greatly increased range of options for breast-conserving surgery such that more women have the option of avoiding mastectomy.<br>using oncoplastic techniques, it is more likely that the cancer is excised with a clear margin at the first attempt. </p>

                <h3>Lymph Node Surgery</h3>
                <p> Any operation for breast cancer includes removing some or all of the lymph glands from the underarm area (axilla). The axilla contains about 15 - 40 lymph nodes, the number varying between individuals. Approximately 35 - 40% of all breast cancers will have spread to one or some of these nodes by the time the cancer is diagnosed.<br>All breast cancer has the potential to spread to other areas of the body. One of the first places breast cancers can spread to is the lymph glands. Removing these allows them to be analysed under the microscope for the presence of cancer cells. If some are found to contain cancer cells then additional treatment will be necessary.<br>The aim of surgery to the lymph nodes is to remove the smallest number of nodes necessary to prove whether breast cancer has spread to them or not.</p>

                <h3>Breast Reconstruction</h3>
                <p>If one or both of your breasts are or were affected by breast cancer, you may choose to have your breasts reconstructed at the time of breast removal or at a later date when all cancer treatments have been finalized. The most natural reconstruction can generally be achieved by using your own tissue.There are several places on your body where you may have excess tissue available. The most common areas are on the abdomen, the buttocks or the thighs. The excess tissue on the abdomen is used for breast reconstruction most often. During this operation skin and fat from the lower abdomen, together with blood vessels supplying that issue, will be used.Your plastic surgeon will remove the tissue from the abdomen and shape a new breast for you.</p>

                <h3>Breast Lift</h3>
                <p>Breast lift surgery raises and firms the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support a new uplifted and rejuvenated breast contour.Women who require breast lift surgery usually have breasts that sag due to aging and or having breastfed. Breasts of any size can be lifted but the best results are usually achieved in women with small, sagging breasts. Sometimes you may also wish to increase the size of the breast in which case combining the procedure with a breast augmentation may be appropriate.<br>Breast lift surgery involves excision of excess skin, re-draping of the remaining skin, repositioning of the nipple +/- reduction of the nipple.</p>

                <h3>cervical cancer surgery</h3>
                <p>There are several surgeries used to treat cervical cancer.

Different surgeries involve removing:<br>

-part of the cervix – only possible if the cancer is very small<br>
-the cervix and upper part of the vagina – the womb is not removed, so it's possible to get pregnant in the future.<br>
-the cervix and womb (hysterectomy) – can include removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes.<br>
-the cervix, womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes, and all or parts of the bladder, bowel, vagina or rectum – this is only offered if the cancer has come back and other treatment is not possible<br>
You may need to have some lymph nodes, which are part of the body’s drainage system, removed.<br>
Recovery from these surgeries can take a long time depending on the surgery.</p>

                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                <p>Chemotherapy (chemo) uses anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or given by mouth. These drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach almost all areas of the body, making this treatment useful for killing cancer cells in most parts of the body.
<br>
Not all women with cervical cancer will need chemo, but there are a few situations in which chemo may be recommended<br>Chemo drugs kill cancer cells but also damage some normal cells, which can lead to certain side effects. Side effects depend on the type and dose of the drugs and the length of time you are treated. Many side effects are short-term and go away after treatment is finished, but some can last a long time or even be permanent. </p>

                <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
                <p>Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Depending on the stage of the cervical cancer, radiation therapy may be used:<br>

-As a part of the main treatment. For some stages of cervical cancer, the preferred treatment is radiation alone or surgery followed by radiation. For other stages, radiation and chemo given together (called concurrent chemoradiation) is the preferred treatment as the chemo helps the radiation work better.<br>
-To treat cervical cancer that has spread or that has come back after treatment. Radiation therapy may be used to treat cervical cancers that have spread to other organs and tissues.<br>
The types of radiation therapy most often used to treat cervical cancer are:<br>

1.External beam radiation <br>
2.Brachytherapy </p>
